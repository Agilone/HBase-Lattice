/**
 * Aggregate query interface.
 * <P>
 * 
 * Major capabilities:
 * <UL>
 * 
 * <LI>define slice ({@link #addHalfOpenSlice(String, Object, Object)}, etc. The
 * slice specifications are consistent with mathematical definition of closed
 * and open intervals. Closed boundary means the boundary value is included into
 * the result. Open boundary beans it is not included. Unbounded queries are
 * implicitly supported thru putting closed boundary with maximum value possible
 * for that particular data type. <B>IMPORTANT</B> at this time of this writing,
 * only one range per dimension is supported. If another range is added for the
 * same dimension, it would just simply overwrite the previous one. There's no
 * technical reason not to support multiple slices on the same query except that
 * it is just did not happen to be common case enough to have immediate support
 * for. If multiple slices are needed, they could always be obtained by running
 * a query per slice and then aggregating the results manuallly at this pont.
 * 
 * 
 * <LI>define projection ({@link #addGroupBy(String)}. Note that unlike with
 * RDBMS, there's never a query without projections. If you don't specify any
 * dimension for grouping, it assumes full group projection rather than access
 * to individual facts (i.e. such query will always return only one tuple
 * corresponding to the entire slice). Access to individual facts from original
 * fact stream is in fact not possible, as we never ever save individual facts
 * anywhere. This project will assume one could obtain individual facts from
 * some other system of record.
 * 
 * <LI>define desired measures to be output ({@link #addMeasure(String)}.
 * 
 * </UL>
 * <P>
 * 
 * Note that query initialization is relatively expensive. If you use HBL system
 * table to pull cube model definitions from, then this will be executed during
 * AggregateQuery construction. To make sure there's best performance, try to
 * reuse query objects, with help of {@link #reset()}.
 * <P>
 * 
 * This contracts also assume that actual implementation is non-reentrant (not
 * thread safe).
